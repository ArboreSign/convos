Convos is the simplest way to use [IRC](http://www.irchelp.org/). It is always
online, and accessible to your web browser, both on desktop and mobile. Run in
on your home server, or [cloud service](https://www.digitalocean.com/) easily.
It can be deployed to Docker-based cloud services, or you can just run it as a
normal [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org/) application.

Learn more about how to install and configure Convos in the
[manual](/doc).

## Demo

There is an online demo running at [demo.convos.by](http://demo.convos.by).
Register with what-ever email you like and start poking around. There should
be someone lurking in the "#test" channel.

DISCLAIMER! There are no guaranties for the uptime or quality of that service.

## Features

### Always online

The backend server will keep you logged in and logs all the activity in your
archive.

### Archive

All chats will be logged and indexed, which allow you to search in earlier
conversations.

### Include external resources

Links to images and video will be displayed inline. No need to click on the
link to view the data.

## Architecture principles

* Easy to run - Optional complexity.
* Easy to use for both humans and computers.
* Easy to develop and extend.
