Convos::Manual::Running - How to start Convos

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Convos> can run in different modes, but we suggest running with a seperate
backend, since it allows you to restart the frontend without disconnecting
from the IRC servers.

NOTE! If you run convos from a checked out git repo, wou need to run the
commands with C<./vendor/bin/carton exec> infront of the commands. Example:

  # This...
  $ hynotoad script/convos
  $ convos daemon

  # becomes...
  $ ./vendor/bin/carton exec hypnotoad script/convos
  $ ./vendor/bin/carton exec ./script/convos daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ ./script/convos
  $ ./script/convos [command] [options]

=head1 MODES

=head2 Single process mode

Running Convos in single process mode is the simplest way to get started.
In this mode, it will run the backend (The process that connects to the IRC
servers) embedded. This might even be required, if you want to run Convos
on a service similar to Heroku. (NOTE: Convos is not supported on Heroku)

To start convos, simply start it with the command "daemon". Below, we have
also supplied the listen parameter which specifies which port to accept
incoming HTTP connections on.

  $ convos daemon --listen http://*:8080

For more details run "help daemon" or have a look at
L<http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/Server/Daemon>.

  $ convos help daemon

=head2 Seperate backend

Starting up the backend seperately is a big win, since it allows you to
upgrade and restart the frontend without tearing down the connections to the
IRC servers. There are two ways to start the backend, either in foreground
or fork to background:

  # Start in foreground
  $ convos backend

  # Fork to background
  $ convos backend start

After you have forked to background, you can investigate the status of
the process, stop or restart it:

  $ convos backend status
  $ convos backend stop
  $ convos backend restart

You can also generate an init script for the backend:

  $ convos backend get_init_file > /etc/init.d/convos-backend

The backend can then be instructed with environment variables from
C</etc/default/convos>.

=head2 Hypnotoad

L<Hypnotoad|http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/Server/Hypnotoad> is a full
featured, UNIX optimized, preforking non-blocking webserver. Using Hypnotoad
is what we suggest, since it can handle a lot more requests, than what
L</Single process mode> can offer. Starting with Hypnotoad can be done with
the following command:

  $ hynotoad script/convos

Run the same command again, and the webserver will
L<hot reload|http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/Server/Hypnotoad#USR2> the source
code without loosing any connections.

We strongly suggest starting with L<MOJO_CONFIG|Convos::Manual::Environment/MOJO_CONFIG>
set, so you can change the environment during L<hot reload|Mojo::Server::Hypnotoad/DESCRIPTION>.

  $ MOJO_CONFIG=/path/to/config.pl hynotoad script/convos

L</Hypnotoad> mode require the backend to be started as a seperate process.
